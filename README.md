# Design of Algorithms

This repository contains algorithms developed during the **Design of Algorithms** course.

### Contents
- **Route Planner Tool**: Calculates the shortest paths with restrictions and alternative routes.
- **Algorithms**: Various algorithms developed during the course.

## Project1 - Route Planner Tool

The project folder includes a **Route Planner Tool** that finds the shortest paths with restrictions and alternative paths using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. The tool can be used to plan routes while considering specific constraints.

### Documentation
Doxygen-generated documentation is available in the project folder for a more detailed understanding of the project's structure and functionality.
